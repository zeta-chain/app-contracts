# ZetaChain Protocol Contracts

This package includes:
* Contracts that interact directly with the protocol (Connector, Zeta token).
* Utilities and interfaces to make it easy to develop multichain dApps on ZetaChain (ZetaInteractor, ZetaInterfaces, ZetaTokenConsumer).

## Addresses

* TSS address: collectively held by Zeta blockchain validators.

- Tss Updater Address: This address will combine a Gnosis multi-sig and Open Zeppelin timelock to ensure transparency and improve security.
