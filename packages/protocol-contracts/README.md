# ZetaChain Protocol Contracts

This package includes:
* Contracts that interact directly with the protocol (Connector, Zeta token).
* Utilities and interfaces to make it easy to develop multichain dApps on ZetaChain (ZetaInteractor, ZetaInterfaces, ZetaTokenConsumer).

## Addresses

* TSS address: collectively held by Zeta blockchain validators.
* TSS Updater address: a Gnosis multi-sig that's under an OpenZeppelin TimeLock for security and transparency. Eventually, the ownership of this role will be delegated to the TSS address.
