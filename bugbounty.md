## Bug Bounty Overview

ZetaChain is committed to security across all aspects of its ecosystem. To that end, ZetaChain has established a bug bounty program to reward researchers, developers, and users who help identify and report security vulnerabilities.

You can access and report issues at [https://immunefi.com/bounty/zetachain/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/zetachain/).

## Scope

The scope of this bug bounty program is focused on ZetaChain's smart contracts, public-facing APIs, blockchain protocol/infrastructure, and web applications.

## Program Guidelines
