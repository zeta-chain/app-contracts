## Opening a Pull Request

A few rules of thumb based on the size of your Pull Request:

* If it's small, like fixing a typo, just send it.
* If it's medium, like working on a feature or a bug, you may want to open an issue to chat with the maintainers before working on it.
* If it's big, do your best to split it into smaller ones.
